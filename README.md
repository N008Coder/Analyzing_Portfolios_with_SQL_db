# Analyzing_Portfolios_with_SQL_db

We analyze a single asset in an ETF by first importing the data from a Database and reading it into a Pandas DataFrame
    We can then visualize the daily returns and cumulative returns of the asset over the give time period 
        We also look at the top 10 days in terms of daily returns for the asset
Next we analyze the entire portfolio by Joining the assets within into a single table and reading it into a Pandas DataFrame
    We can manipulate the tables to show us the cumulative returns of the entire Portfolio
        The output can be ran in a browser using Voila in the command line
